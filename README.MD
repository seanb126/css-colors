# CSS COLORS
<!-- Shields -->
A CSS library that provides a comprehensive list of color classes, to be applied to your HTML elements.

Avoid:
- Creating new classes or using in-line styles to change an elements color
- Having to edit, save and reload your web projects to test a color
- Needing to search Google for the hex code of your desired color
